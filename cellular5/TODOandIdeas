sequences - fibonacci, powers of 2, etc
repeating sequences - repeat sequence up to range, then invert order until 0, then repeat for all uint
fractals - carpet, julia
duplicate nodes for different data types - image node
add support for infinite plane - for wave/repeating functions, noise, etc
add coordinate swap and aspect scale
add polar coods from arbitrary range function
implement color blending
implement kernel operations - sobel like & finite state automata
implement noise extensions from library
implement color functions from palette
implement more conversions - byte -> int etc
implement more data types - signed byte?
implement int coord conversion
implement partitioning nodes
implement boolean equality nodes
implement range function nodes
implement more mutation options, addition, multiplication, etc
implement canvas node and nodes to draw on it
implement iterative scaling for complex fractals, so higher iterations are at a lower scale and therefore more detail is shown without having to seek it out
implement calculations for update time, and mutate more often if running slowly
